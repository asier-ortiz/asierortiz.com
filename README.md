This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, [asierortiz.dev](https://asierortiz.dev/). The website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## About the Project

My personal portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a full-stack developer. The website includes sections such as:

- **Hero Section**: An introductory section with a brief overview of who I am.
- **Background**: Information about my background, including my skills and experience.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my featured projects with descriptions and links.

The website is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, with smooth animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
