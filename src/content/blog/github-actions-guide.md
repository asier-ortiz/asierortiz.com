## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is GitHub's native automation feature that enables CI/CD directly in your repositories. With Actions, you
can build and test code, deploy apps, run scheduled tasks, and respond to various GitHub events like pushes, pull
requests, issues, and more.

It's event-driven and tightly integrated with GitHub, making it easy to set up and scale across different projects and
languages.

---

## 1. Core Concepts

A GitHub Actions **workflow** is triggered by an **event** (such as a `push`, `pull_request`, or a manual dispatch). That event starts a pipeline of automated steps, which are defined using a structured set of concepts:

- **Workflow**: A configurable automation file written in YAML, stored in `.github/workflows/`.
- **Job**: A group of steps that run on the same virtual environment (also called a runner).
- **Step**: An individual task ‚Äî usually a shell command or a call to an action.
- **Action**: A reusable unit of logic that can be used across workflows. You can use official or community actions from the GitHub Marketplace, or create your own.
- **Runner**: The virtual machine where jobs are executed (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`).

---

## 2. Common Use Cases

- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automate test, build, and deployment cycles.
- **Issue management**: Label issues, notify teams, or auto-close stale issues.
- **Dependency updates**: Automatically check for and apply updates.
- **Container workflows**: Build and publish Docker containers.
- **Documentation deployment**: Push markdown docs to GitHub Pages.

---

## 3. Creating Your First Workflow

If you're just getting started, the fastest way to create your first GitHub Action is directly from the GitHub
interface ‚Äî no local setup required.

### üìç Step-by-Step

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.

2. Click the **Actions** tab in the top menu.

3. GitHub will suggest templates based on your project.
   <img
   src="/assets/blog/github-actions-screenshot-1.webp"
   alt="GitHub Actions tab showing template suggestions"
   data-zoomable
   />

4. Choose a template or click **"set up a workflow yourself"** to start from scratch.

   GitHub will open a built-in editor with a new file at `.github/workflows/`.

   Paste the following:

   ```yaml
   name: Hello World

   on: [push]

   jobs:
     greet:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Print greeting
           run: echo "üëã Hello from your first GitHub Action!"
   ```

   <img
   src="/assets/blog/github-actions-screenshot-2.webp"
   alt="YAML editor with hello-world workflow example"
   data-zoomable
   />

5. Click **Commit changes** to save and activate the workflow.

- The workflow will run automatically after each `git push`.
- You can view its execution in the **Actions** tab, where each step is logged in real-time.
- If something fails, GitHub shows exactly where and why.
  <img
  src="/assets/blog/github-actions-screenshot-3.webp"
  alt="GitHub Actions run result showing successful output"

  />

> üí° Once you're comfortable, you can define more complex workflows or store them in your repo directly.

## 4. Practical Examples

### üß™ Example: Continuous Integration for Node.js

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build the project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

> **Explanation:**
> Ensures that every change pushed to the repository or suggested through a pull request is automatically validated by
> building and executing tests.


### üß™ Example: Deployment to GitHub Pages

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

> **Explanation:**
> After building the project, this workflow publishes the content of the `./dist` folder to GitHub Pages automatically.


### üß™ Example: Daily Scheduled Cleanup

```yaml
name: Daily Cleanup

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * *'  # Runs daily at 3 AM UTC

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Cleanup temp files
        run: npm run cleanup
```

> **Explanation:**
> Runs daily to perform maintenance tasks such as cleaning up temporary files.


### üß™ Example: Publish to NPM on Tag Push

```yaml
name: Publish to NPM

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org/'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Publish package
        run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

> **Explanation:**
> Triggered when a new version tag is pushed, this workflow installs dependencies and publishes the package to NPM using
> a secret authentication token.


### üß™ Example: Send Slack Notification on Push

```yaml
name: Slack Notification

on:
  push:

jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Send notification to Slack
        uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
          SLACK_MESSAGE: 'A new commit has been pushed to the repository!'
```

> **Explanation:**
> Each push triggers a Slack message to a specified channel using a secure webhook URL.

---

## 5. Using Secrets in Workflows

You may have noticed that some of the examples above reference values like `${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}` or
`${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}`. These are known as **GitHub Secrets**, and they're essential for securely handling
sensitive information in your workflows.

Many automation tasks require access to credentials such as API keys, access tokens, or webhook URLs. Instead of
hardcoding these into your workflow files (which is insecure and discouraged), GitHub allows you to store them securely
in your repository settings.

### How to add a secret

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret**.
4. Add a name like `NPM_TOKEN` or `SLACK_WEBHOOK` and paste the corresponding value.

Once added, you can reference your secret in any workflow file like this:

```yaml
env:
  NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

---

## 6. Advanced Workflows

GitHub Actions can scale with your projects, supporting advanced automation scenarios. Here are some patterns and
features you can use to unlock powerful workflows:

- **Matrix builds**: Run jobs across multiple environments (OS, language versions, etc.) to ensure cross-compatibility.
- **Reusable workflows**: Share and reuse entire workflows across repositories or teams, improving maintainability.
- **Environment-specific jobs**: Use conditional logic (`if:`) to trigger jobs only in certain environments like staging
  or production.
- **Manual triggers**: Allow manual execution of workflows through `workflow_dispatch`, useful for deployments or fixes.
- **Artifacts and logs**: Upload generated files, logs, or reports using `actions/upload-artifact` for later inspection.
- **Conditional job chaining**: Combine `needs` and job outputs to create sophisticated job dependencies.
- **Dynamic expressions**: Use `${{ }}` syntax with contexts and functions to dynamically control your workflows (e.g.,
  `${{ github.actor }}`, `${{ steps.step_id.outputs.result }}`).
- **Third-party integrations**: Trigger workflows from external services using `repository_dispatch` events.

### üß™ Example: Workflow Dispatch with Custom Inputs

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deployment target'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
```

> Enables manual triggering from the GitHub UI with custom parameters.


### üß™ Example: Uploading Artifacts

```yaml
- name: Upload coverage report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: coverage-report
    path: ./coverage/
```

> Save build results, test coverage reports, or other generated assets for download or review.


### üß™ Example: Conditional Jobs Based on Environment

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

> This job runs only if the push was to the `main` branch.

## 7. Best Practices

- **Keep it simple**: Break large workflows into smaller, manageable files.
- **Cache dependencies**: Improve build times using `actions/cache`.
- **Secure secrets**: Store tokens and API keys in `Settings > Secrets`.
- **Use pinned versions**: Reference specific versions (`@v4`, `@v2`) instead of `@latest`.
- **Avoid redundancy**: Reuse logic with composite actions or reusable workflows.
- **Monitor runs**: Set up failure alerts and track metrics.

---

## 8. Next Steps

- Read the official [GitHub Actions Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).
- Explore pre-built [actions on the Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions).
